JMesa is a dynamic HTML table that allows you to filter, sort, paginate, export and edit your data however you need to. What you will find here is a carefully thought out API that is very easy to use and can be modified for your own needs.

**I have decided to officially stop developing JMesa. It has been a long time since I have worked on the project and server side rendering of components no longer feels like the best way to develop web applications. If you are using JMesa right now I would not worry though as I still use it in my projects (for now) and this site will continue to exist for the foreseeable future.**

JMesa requires JDK 1.5 or above. If you are running in a JDK 1.4 environment you can use the [JBoss Retro](http://community.jboss.org/wiki/JBossRetro) jar along with the jmesa-retro.jar.

If you would like to use Maven, the link to the central repository is http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/jmesa/jmesa/. A huge thanks to Jeff Jensen for building the pom.xml and helping me navigate the Maven publish process!

_It would be great to have more Locales supported out of the box. If your Locale is not currently supported you should consider taking some time to create a messages file and send it to me. More details are on the [Messages](Messages.md) page._
